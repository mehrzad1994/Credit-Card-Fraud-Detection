# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit Card Fraud detection using cloud-based big data analytics and AIOps comprises 3 main things, Data Analytics, cloud services, and Big data.

## Overview
The overall objective of this project is to deal with the data generated from credit card transactions and use that data for analyzing the trends in the transaction leveraging the cloud services. We primarily focused on the volume element of the data due to the limits of cloud usage. The credit card transaction, on the other hand, contains both the Volume and Velocity components of Big data in the real world. Based on the analytics on transaction history, we can uncover suspicious activity and perform appropriate Identity and Access Management (IAM) actions as per the business requirements. The results of the analytics will be integrated with the transaction service of the system. Based on the analytics result and the traditional transaction service result, the system decides whether the transaction has to be approved or declined.  

## Background and Motivation
Credit card fraud is when someone uses another person's credit card or account information to make unauthorized purchases. “Fraud detection is a set of activities that are taken to prevent money from being obtained through false pretenses.”
There are multiple Challenges to fraud detection 
●	Need to gather historical transaction data
●	Handle real-time transactions
●	Security of the transactional data 

Existing Solutions
The traditional way of fraud detection without data analytics
In the traditional way, the number of people using credit cards on a daily basis was comparatively less and the transactions were manageable.
Earlier before the transaction was processed the banking sector used to verify the transaction that seemed to deviate from the usual transaction pattern with complete manpower indulged in analyzing these patterns. 
In this way, the banking firm had to consistently engage themselves in analyzing each transaction and cross verifying with the account holder if the transaction was actually initiated by them. 

As a result, the banking institution had to devote constant time to examining
 each transaction and double-checking with the account holder to ensure that the transaction was truly started by them.

Conventional Fraud Detection:
●	The rules of making a decision on determining schemes should be set manually.
●	Takes an enormous amount of time
●	Multiple verification methods are needed; thus, inconvenient for the user
●	Finds only obvious fraud activities


## Goals
Proposed Solution
Analytics need not replace what you’re already doing—it can be an extra layer
to enhance and extend existing efforts.
Unsupervised or non-rules-based analyses driven by analytics technology
can uncover new patterns, trends, fraudulent schemes, and scenarios that
traditional approaches miss.

Detecting fraud is part of a process that starts even before you begin to analyze data; 
More often than not, there will be a high number of anomalies from the data analytics process, with very few actually being errors and even fewer being actual fraudulent transactions. 
But with professional judgment and some intuition (based on experience with an organization), data analytics will make the process faster, more focused, and easier. 

In the modern data analytical forum, the initial manpower induced in engaging themselves in tracking the anomalies is reduced. 
Now as credit cards usage has grown, the data generated by them has also increased constituting large volumes of data that can be used to analyze that data and automate the prediction of anomalies when there is a deviation in the transaction pattern. 
When the analytic model predicts that there is an anomaly then the system can automatically hold on to the transaction and process it only when the transaction is verified by the account holders.
Machine Learning-based Fraud Detection:
●	Detecting fraud automatically
●	Real-time streaming
●	Less time needed for verification methods
●	Identifying hidden correlations in data

Role of Big Data in Fraud Detection
Day-to-day transactions and historical transactions have grown to several PB in recent years. Increasing volumes, velocity, and variability of data are making machine learning algorithms less efficient. The Big data frameworks will facilitate efficient data ingestion to analytical servers.

## Practical Applications

Cloud-based Services

The entire system setup uses multiples services provided by the AWS cloud. Each service used and the purpose for which it has been used is pointed out below:

● EC2: Amazon’s Elastic compute cloud provides the service of virtual computers. The transaction microservices and the front end application is hosted using these EC2 instances.

● S3: Amazon S3 is a simple storage service. The storing and retrieving of data sets, storing the preporossed data, and also the storage of all microservies deployed is handled by the S3 buckets.

● Elastic Beanstalk: As an alternative to explicitly configuring EC2, S3 and load balancers, AWS provides elastic beanstalk as a combined service that allows to deploy applications independent of configurations. This service is used to deploy our flask based microservcie in which the preprocessing of each incoming transaction is handled.

● Sagemaker: Used to create ML model, train the model and deploy the trained model in cloud

● AWS Lambda: It is a computing service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources required by that code. The end point of the ML model is triggered from the lamda function

● Amazon API Gateway: The lambda function is exposed to other services via the API Gateway service.

Cloud-based Data Analytics

Cloud-based Data analytics is the process of using analytic algorithms in the cloud to analyse data in a private or public cloud and then delivering a desired result. Cloud analytics entails the use of scalable cloud computing in conjunction with advanced analytic tools to find patterns in data and derive new insights. Amazon services are used for data analytics part of this project.
4.3.1 SageMaker

SageMaker is the machine learning service for amazon. SageMaker can be used to design and train machine learning models fast and simple without considering infrastructure needs. It has the ability to deploy the developed model directly as an endpoint that is production ready hosted environment. There is no need for server and environment management as its all handled by SageMaker. This project uses SageMaker itself and many of its subservices and features.
4.3.2 XGBoost
XGBoost stands for “Extreme Gradient Boosting”. It is a distributed gradient boosting library that is geared for efficiency, flexibility, and portability. It uses the Gradient Boosting framework to construct machine learning algorithms. XGBoost uses parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT or GBM) to tackle a variety of data science issues quickly and accurately. The same algorithm may tackle problems with billions of instances in a distributed environment (Hadoop, SGE, MPI).
